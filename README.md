# Codewars-JavaScript Practice ðŸ§ 

This repo holds my JavaScript solutions to Codewars problems.  
Thereâ€™s no folder structure â€” just a growing collection of `.js` files as I work through challenges of varying difficulty.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Why This Exists

- Stay sharp with JavaScript syntax
- Practice problem solving across multiple languages
- Reinforce fundamentals: arrays, loops, string manipulation, recursion, etc.
- Track my growth and revisit patterns I struggled with

---

## ðŸ—‚ What's Inside

- Each file is typically named after the kata or pattern
- Comments may include alternate approaches or notes
- Not every solution is optimal â€” this is about repetition and fluency

## ðŸš§ Ongoing

This is a learning sandbox. I push whenever I get a few reps in â€” no fancy structure, just raw practice.
